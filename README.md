# odin-landing-page

This will be my 2nd project from ToP. I will be creating a web page from a provided design. It's supposed to teach me how to create something frrom scratch
and get elements in the right positions. I will be revisitting this README after I have ended the project.

Revisiting the readme after finishing the project. This felt like a real challenge, having to start everything from scratch. I loved figuring it out slowly by myself and I'm happy with 
how it turned out and what I learned. Looking forward to what comes next!
